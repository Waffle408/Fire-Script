# Fire Script
 A basic FiveM script that starts fires.
 based on https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-firescript-v1-0-alpha/36724, But fixed so it runs server sided instead of client side and spawns a bunch of fire for every player.




 How it works
    It generates a random number between the specifed numbers at the top of server and client
    it then waits that generated number and then picks a number between 1 and 1000 and if that number is bigger than the spawn fire chance varible at the top
    then it checks to see if there is a certain number of people with the job 'fire' if there is
    it chooses a number between 1 and 16 which are the location (i know there are better ways to code the location choosing but it wasnt working properly for some weird reason if you want to make it less complicated than feel free to fork it :D)
    then it sends that data to the person with the lowest id that is a firie and syncs the fires. was the easiest way to do it.










Feel free to check out my other random shit, most of the time i dont make scripts and just fix them but i am working on something so check arounf i guess. if you need quick bug fixes contact me on discord i guess, Waffle406#9816.
